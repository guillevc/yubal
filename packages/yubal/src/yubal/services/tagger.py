class AudioFileTaggingService:
    """Service for applying metadata tags to audio files.

    Pipeline Overview:
    ==================
    1. apply_metadata_tags() - Main entry point: writes all metadata to audio file
    2. _write_basic_metadata() - Applies core tags (title, artist, album)
    3. _write_track_numbering() - Applies track position information
    4. _write_year_metadata() - Parses and applies release year
    5. _write_cover_art() - Embeds album artwork into the file

    Why use mediafile: The mediafile library provides a unified interface for
    tagging multiple audio formats (MP3, FLAC, M4A, etc.) with proper format-specific
    handling (ID3 tags for MP3, Vorbis comments for FLAC, etc.).

        """Apply complete metadata tags to an audio file.

        This is the main tagging pipeline. It writes all available metadata to the
        audio file in the correct format for that file type. The mediafile library
        handles format-specific details (ID3v2 for MP3, Vorbis for FLAC, etc.).

        Why separate steps: Breaking tagging into logical sections (basic metadata,
        track numbers, year, cover art) makes it easier to debug issues and add
        format-specific handling in the future.

        What gets written:
        - Basic metadata: title, artist(s), album, album artist(s)
        - Track numbering: track position and total tracks
        - Release year: parsed from string to integer
        - Cover art: JPEG or PNG embedded image

        Args:
            path: Path to the audio file to tag.
            track: Complete track metadata to write.
            cover: Optional cover art bytes (JPEG or PNG). The Image class
                auto-detects MIME type from magic bytes.

        Raises:
            Exception: If tagging fails. Caller should handle gracefully to avoid
                stopping the entire download process due to one tagging error.

        Example:
            >>> tagger = AudioFileTaggingService()
            >>> tagger.apply_metadata_tags(
            ...     Path("track.mp3"),

        Why check for None: Not all tracks have numbering information (e.g., singles,

        to an integer.

        Why graceful fallback: If the year field contains unexpected data (e.g.,
        "2024-03-15" or invalid text), we log it but don't fail. Better to have
        a track without a year than to fail the entire tagging operation.
