    Pipeline Overview:
    ==================
    1. extract() - Main entry point: fetches playlist, classifies content type,
                   yields progress updates as tracks are processed
    2. _classify_playlist_as_album_or_playlist() - Determines if OLAK5uy_
                   playlists represent complete albums vs curated playlists
    3. _extract_single_track() - Processes each track: validates video type,
                   searches for album info, builds complete metadata
    4. _match_playlist_track_to_album() - Four-tier matching strategy to find
                   the corresponding album track (video ID → title → duration → fuzzy)
    5. _build_metadata_with_album_info() - Constructs final TrackMetadata using
                   enriched album information

        This is the main extraction pipeline. It automatically detects whether
        the URL is a single track, album, or playlist, then processes accordingly.
        Progress updates are yielded as each track completes, making this ideal
        for CLI progress bars or UI updates.

        - Single track: https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID
        - Album: https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_...
        - Playlist: https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL...
