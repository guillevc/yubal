    Pipeline Overview:
    ==================
    1. compose() - Main entry point: orchestrates M3U and cover generation
                   based on configuration flags and content type
    2. _collect_successful_tracks_for_playlist() - Filters download results
                   to include only successful and skipped tracks (both should
                   appear in the final playlist)
    3. Delegates to utility functions (write_m3u, write_playlist_cover) for
       actual file generation

    This service is stateless and operates purely on the results of completed
    downloads. It does not perform any downloads or API calls itself.

    Example:
        >>> composer = PlaylistArtifactsService()
        >>> artifacts = composer.compose(
        ...     base_path=Path("./music"),
        ...     playlist_info=playlist_info,
        ...     results=download_results,
        ... )
        >>> artifacts.m3u   # Path or None
        >>> artifacts.cover  # Path or None

        This is the main composition pipeline. It takes completed download results

        1. M3U playlist file - Contains relative paths to all tracks
        2. Playlist cover image - Saved as a sidecar JPEG file

        (one folder per album with all tracks inside). An M3U file is redundant
        for albums but valuable for curated playlists where tracks come from
        different albums and folders.

        Why include skipped tracks: Both SUCCESS and SKIPPED tracks should appear
        in the playlist. SKIPPED means the file already existed and was not
        re-downloaded, but it's still part of the playlist.
